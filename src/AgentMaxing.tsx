                        haven't noticed it yet. They're too busy asking ChatGPT to write

                        For two years, the conversation about AI has been stuck in the
                        wrong frame. Will it take my job? Will it replace developers,
                        writers, lawyers, designers? These are the wrong questions
                        because they assume the dividing line runs between professions. It
                        doesn't. It runs straight through them.

                        For most of the last century, work has rewarded a specific
                        archetype: the person who executes well within a system someone
                        else built. You wait for the assignment, you complete the
                        assignment, you wait for the next one. Skills mattered, but they
                        mattered inside a structure of supervision, sign-off, and slow
                        approval. The structure protected mediocre execution and punished
                        people who moved too fast. It was a great deal if you liked
                        meetings.

                        That world is dissolving. When one person with a laptop, a Claude
                        subscription, and a few hours can produce what used to take a team
                        a quarter, the bottleneck stops being capability and becomes
                        initiative. The constraint shifts from <em>can you do it</em> to{" "}
                        <em>will you actually go do it without anyone asking</em>.

                        <em>can't</em>. They've spent their entire careers being handed
                        problems pre-defined, scoped, and approved. Take away the
                        scaffolding and they freeze. They open the AI tool, type "what
                        should I work on?", stare at the cursor for a while, and close the
                        tab to go check Slack instead. Slack is comforting. Slack has
                        notifications, which feel like assignments.

                        problem nobody assigned you and starts working on it before anyone
                        has decided whether you're allowed to.

                        mediocre. Sometimes they're embarrassing. What's different is
                        upstream of the prompt entirely.

                        Natural doers convert vague unease into concrete artifacts. They
                        notice something annoying about their workflow on Tuesday and by
                        Wednesday they've built a rough script that mostly fixes it. The
                        script is ugly. The fix is partial. There's a hardcoded value in
                        there that will absolutely cause problems later. They ship it
                        anyway and improve it next week. The non-doer in the same situation
                        is still drafting a Slack message asking whether anyone else has
                        noticed the problem, then deleting it because it sounds too
                        negative, then rewriting it with three emojis to soften the tone.

                        Natural doers treat AI as a collaborator they manage rather than an
                        oracle they consult. They give it half-formed ideas and iterate.
                        They don't wait until they know exactly what they want before
                        starting. They start <em>to find out</em> what they want. The
                        output of the first attempt is the input to the second attempt, and
                        the gap between attempt one and attempt ten is hours, not months.

                        Natural doers have a high tolerance for working on things nobody
                        validated yet. This is the deepest difference, and also the one
                        nobody wants to admit. Most professional training conditions you to
                        seek validation before effort: get the brief approved, get the
                        budget signed off, get the stakeholder aligned, schedule a kickoff
                        meeting to discuss the kickoff meeting. AI tools collapse the cost
                        of trying things to nearly zero, but only for people whose nervous
                        systems can handle building something that nobody asked for. If you
                        need permission to start, the cost reduction doesn't help you.
                        You're still gated upstream of the tools, sitting in a room waiting
                        for someone to say go.

                        Here's what makes this moment unusual. In previous technology
                        shifts, the gap between the early movers and everyone else closed
                        eventually. Email was once exotic; now your grandmother sends them,
                        often in 48-point font with mysterious subject lines like "Fwd:
                        Fwd: Fwd: read this". The Excel power user of 1995 has long since
                        been outpaced by ordinary office workers who picked it up in their
                        own time.

                    <p className="text-sm mb-6 leading-[1.65] font-[410]">
                        AI agents are different because the gap compounds. Every project a
                        doer completes teaches them something about how to direct these
                        tools, which makes the next project faster, which produces more
                        learning, which makes the project after that faster still. The
                        non-doer's experience curve is flat. They're not building projects,
                        so they're not building intuition. They're building opinions about
                        AI, which is a different and much less useful skill. A year from
                        now, the doer has shipped forty things and developed taste,
                        judgment, and a workflow. The non-doer has read forty articles
                        about AI and feels roughly the same as they did a year ago, except
                        slightly more anxious.

                        This doesn't mean doers will become billionaires and non-doers will
                        become destitute. The economy is more complicated than that, and
                        also more forgiving. But within any given field, the spread between
                        the top operators and the median is going to widen dramatically,
                        and the deciding variable will be something almost orthogonal to
                        traditional credentials. Your MBA will not save you. Your years of
                        experience will not save you. The thing that will save you is
                        whether you can sit down on a Saturday and build something nobody
                        asked for.

                        mostly trainable, and the training is unglamorous: you start things
                        without finishing the planning. You ship work that embarrasses you
                        slightly. You get used to the feeling of operating without a clear
                        assignment, which initially feels like being lost in a parking lot.
                        You build a habit of asking <em>what would I do right now if no one
                            was going to evaluate this</em> and then doing that thing, even
                        though some part of your brain will insist this is reckless and
